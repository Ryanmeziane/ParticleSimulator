# ParticleSimulator

## Overview
This JavaScript simulation visualizes the interactions between particles within a canvas element. It models basic physics principles such as gravitational pull and boundary collision.

## Features
- **Particle Creation**: Generates a set of particles with random initial velocities.
- **Gravitational Attraction**: Particles attract each other based on their mass and distance.
- **Collision and Merging**: Particles merge upon collision, resulting in a larger mass.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Particles rebound when they hit the canvas edges.
- **Speed Limiting**: Velocity of particles is limited to ensure stability of the simulation.

## How to Run
